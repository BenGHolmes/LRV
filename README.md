## Inspiration
Research from Press Ganey Associates found that the average ER wait time in 2009 was 6 hours, which is plenty of time for a patient's condition to worsen significantly before they are seen. Despite best efforts, it is difficult for staff to monitor all patients waiting be seen, which puts them at risk.

## Solution
We had the idea for a system that could visually monitor the vital signs of multiple people in the waiting room and alert nurses to any abnormalities. Currently, we have used a Kinect sensor to accurately monitor the breathing of multiple people simultaneously, and send an alert if the breathing rates are outside of normal ranges. In the future, this sensor could easily be extended to monitor temperature and heart rate, which can be done using a camera as shown in Gambi, Ennio et al.[1].
